\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}



In this paper, by performing an automated analysis on the data that we have collected, we attempt to answer
the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What "lifespan profiles" can we cluster browser features into? Are there any "permanently removed" features, and if so, how old/established were they? How long is the feature lifespan of removed features?
  \item With respect to bloating, if we map the number of features per browser, how does the trend look? Are feature numbers increasing linearly, exponentially, etc.?
  \item Who is leading and who is following in introducing features? Are we seeing some major differences in terms of feature introduction and removal between Firefox and Chrome?
  \item Is there a relation between number of features in a browser and number of vulnerabilities that exist on that browser?
  \item Are browsers becoming more fingerprintable?
\end{enumerate}

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: The next section describes our
methodology and data gathering technique. Section 3 presents an analysis of the feature reports and their relation to browser vulnerability. In
Section 4, we present the related work and then briefly conclude the paper in
Section 5.
