Web browsers have become important services in our
daily lives. Millions of users use browsers for different purposes such as using social media applications, online shopping, surfing the web, or having fun. Unfortunately, browsers are also frequently targeted by attackers. In this paper, we perform an empirical analysis of a large number of vulnerability reports and browser features with the aim of understanding what is happening in the web browsers' world and also how browser features are affecting vulnerabilities.
