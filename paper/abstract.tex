Web browsers have become important services in our
daily lives. Millions of users use web browsers for different purposes such as using social media, online shopping, or surfing the web. Some of these services track and profile their users which can be in contrast with the privacy of users. The technique of identifying individual Web users and tracking them is called Browser Fingerprinting. Browsers are also frequently targeted by attackers. In this paper, we perform an empirical analysis of a large number of browser features intending to evaluate fingerprinting possibility and also vulnerability issues that are based on different browser features.
